# Contribution guidelines

If you notice a notable company in GitHub with something interesting in their public repositories, please make a pull request adding it.


## Requirements for a successful addition

* Structure of the items:
  ```
  [Name](URL) | Languages
  ```
* Include a company name and a link to the GitHub organization using the Markdown format.
  * For example:
    ```
    [GitHub, Inc.](https://github.com/github) | Language1, Language2, Language3
    ```
* Include a list of programming languages used on the Git repositories of the company.
  * Separate the company name/link and list of languages with a vertical pipe character (`|`) to keep the table formatted in correct way.
* For example:
  ```
  [GitHub, Inc.](https://github.com/github) | Ruby, Markdown, HTML, CSS, Go, Shell, CoffeeScript, C#, C, C++, Objective-C, Java, PowerShell, Puppet, Go, Clojure, Swift
  ```
* Try to keep the list in alphabetical order.
  * Atom package [sort-lines](https://atom.io/packages/sort-lines) works nicely keeping content sorted.
